The Mini-Project consits of a game of chess. Two players can play the game using keyboard.
The players are supposed to enter the initial position and final position and if they are valid,
the corresponding chess pieces will move from initial to final position.
The code won't execute and run in codeblocks, an error message indicating graphics.h will appear
stating that there is no file named graphics.h.
So i suggest user's to run the Codeblocks-EP which can be downloaded from the following link

http://codeblocks.codecutter.org/

In Codeblocks-EP , [File]->[New]->[Project]->[WinBGIm Project] 

can be used to create new project consisting of graphical components.
